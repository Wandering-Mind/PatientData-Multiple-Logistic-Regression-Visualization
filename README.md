# PatientData-Multiple-Logistic-Regression-Visualization
3 Python programs using data from ny.gov patient data (https://data.ny.gov/resource/w8eu-45mn.json)/(https://data.ny.gov/resource/w8eu-45mn.json?$select=sexual_orientation,program_category,mental_illness) with the goal of supporting decision making and insight support.  The first program is to fit a multiple regression model using values from the dataset.  The second program is to fit a logistic regression model using values from the taxi_trips dataset.  The third program is to create at least one data visualization

Multiple Regression

For this part of the assignment, the dependent variable needs to be a numeric valued column for which you would like to estimate values based on other columns.  Your independent variables should include at least one numeric valued column and at least one dummy/indicator variable based on the data in your data set.  Your program should include the following:

Comments to explain what is happening at each step as well as one in the beginning of your code that has your name and the date the code was created and/or last modified.
Code that prepares your data by creating a dummy/indicator column based on a column that has either categorical or numerical data.
Use of the statsmodels package to fit the multiple regression model and to print out the model summary results.
Also, please write up a summary of the results, commenting on the decision you are trying to support with the model as well as which variables are significant and the interpretation of your model results.

Logistic Regression

For this part of the assignment, the dependent variable needs to be a 0-1 valued column.  Fit a logistic regression model using a categorical variable as the dependent variable and write up a brief summary of the results, commenting on the decision you are trying to support with the model as well as which variables are significant and the interpretation of your model results.

Data Visualization

For this portion of the assignment, create a Python program that uses the seaborn package to create visualization(s) of the data from your dataset.  Your completed assignment is to include the following: 

Comments to explain what is happening at each step as well as one in the beginning of your code that has your name and the date the code was created and/or last modified.
At least one visualization that uses the seaborn package that includes at least two plots charted together.
Also, prepare a brief write-up that comments on how the visualization(s) that you developed support the decision(s) you are making.
